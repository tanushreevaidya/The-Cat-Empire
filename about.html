  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>

For over a decade, The Cat Empire have been known far and wide as one of the world’s greatest party bands. Their colourful, genre-bending music, shipped across the world in traveler’s backpacks seems at home almost anywhere, and yet the band has always been a kind of illusive stranger.
Difficult to describe and impossible to categorise, The Cat Empire’s reputation is built upon a chaotic and fiercely uplifting live show that, last year over half a million people bought tickets to see. Much like their other annual expeditions the band’s 2015 tour covered 15 different countries including Hurricane & Southside Festival in Germany, Secret Garden Party in the UK, Rock Wertcher in Belgium, and a career highlight headline show at the prestigious Royal Albert Hall in London which sold out months in advance.

And yet every time the band is asked, ‘how would you describe your music?’ – there is no clear answer, other than it is for dancing to. That seems to be the official response.

In 2013 the Cat Empire’s fifth studio album, ‘Steal the Light’, was released to widespread acclaim. Described as “a brilliantly diverse yet cohesive album which succeeds exceedingly well when it comes to creating a great dance vibe” – AU Review and “it could be played anywhere in the world and people will connect on any cultural level” – Rip It Up, ‘Steal The Light’ solidified the energy and chaos of The Cat Empire experience into a technicolour record that entered the national ARIA Chart at #3 – delivering the band their 4th consecutive Top #5 debut. The lead single from the album, ‘Brighter Than Gold’, also went on to become the most played song on high rating Dutch radio station  3FM in 2013.

The new record continues in a similar vein.  Recorded in their home town of Melbourne with ‘Steal The Light’ producer and long-time friend Jan Skubiszewski, ‘Rising With The Sun’ explores and deepens the themes established in the previous album. “That sound is the world we want to live in,” explains frontman Felix Riebl. “It’s an explosive world, filled with fireworks, exotic flavours and deep rhythm”. “We wanted it to feel like you are watching a parade marching past” adds trumpeter Harry James Angus.  And that is exactly how it feels – like a big, colourful, cacophonous parade is passing by your window, or like the running of the bulls.


The approach in the studio for ‘Rising With The Sun’ was different for almost every song.  The single ’Wolves’ was recorded live in one take, with no separation, no vocal overdubbing, no room to go back and change things; which is just the way the band likes it.  “’Wolves’ is one of the most unique songs we’ve ever released”, said Felix “It’s got a Caribbean disco edge, with an African-sounding melodic hook played on a (broken) toy synthesiser, and a dance anthem chorus. It’s quite chaotic, about running away from any kind of boring situation.”

Boring is the last thing anyone could accuse The Cat Empire of.  This is the band who in their own words “tricked pop radio into playing jazz” and went on to sell over 2 million records.  They have paved their own creative path – ‘Rising With The Sun’ is their second release as a global independent band – and in the spirit of having a good time, have spent well over a decade routing tours to include their next list of desirable cities to visit.

“There’s a lot of celebration on ‘Rising With The Sun’,” concludes Felix, “in terms of ‘celebrating’ what The Cat Empire is, and what it means to people to come to the shows and be a part of that celebration and self-abandon for a night. I don’t want to make grand statements about whether it’s our best album or not,… It doesn’t really matter. It’s true to what the band is and what has kept people coming back to our shows for quite a long time (and) that’s something that’s really great.”</p>
